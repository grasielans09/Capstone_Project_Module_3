# **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**

## **Project Introduction**
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using advanced regression techniques. CLV is a critical metric for understanding the long-term profitability of customers and helps businesses make informed decisions about marketing, sales, and customer retention strategies.

The project explores various machine learning models, including **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **AdaBoost**, with an emphasis on model optimization, feature selection, and performance evaluation to provide the most accurate CLV predictions.

## **Project Objectives**
1. Develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting **Customer Lifetime Value**.
2. Optimize and tune models to improve predictive accuracy and reduce error metrics.
3. Analyze and interpret feature importance to enhance model explainability.
4. Evaluate model performance using key metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R².
5. Compare models before and after hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
